android NFC Examples
===========

eclipse/ has the examples in eclipse project format, no longer updated.  Otherwise the examples are for android studio.

<b>nfc3</b> will set a nfc tag.

<b>nfcDemo</b> uses beam.

<b>nfcDemo3</b> well send a file via nfc beam.

<b>StickyNotes</b> can read and write nfc tag.

These are attempts at working demo for NFC.  Sometimes they just don't work and I don't know why.  There has also been changes with the API, so that contribute to the problems as well.

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.
All examples are for Android.
